			<p>Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by the Oracle Corporation,<br> that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment.</p>
			<p>Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers.<br> Java applets, which are less common than standalone Java applications, were commonly run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications through being embedded in HTML pages</p>
			<p>It's still possible to run Java in web browsers after most of them having dropped support for Java's VM</p>

      <p>In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename.</p>
      <p>The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code</p>
      <p>public class MyClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World");
  }
}</p>

			<header><h2>Syntax</h2></header>
			<p>Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class MyClass. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.</p>
      <p>The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.</p>

		<section id="Comments" class="main-section">
			<header><h2>Comments</h2></header>
		 <p>Comments can be used to explain Java code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code.</p>
     <p>Single-line comments starts with two forward slashes (//).</p>
      <p>Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed)</p>
